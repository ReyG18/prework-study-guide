# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This study guide was built for students who not only need help organizing what they've learned, but also to give structure to their independent study. It includes dedicated sections for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- Information will include how GitBash, GitHub, and VS Code work together from version control to merging branches as well as how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to give structure, add style, and finally add functions to make a website fully functional.

## Usage

-This study guide works alongside the console in your browser (F12 in Windows, Command+Option+I in macOS), as the console allows us to see how JavaScript runs while we debug and practice code. 
-Each topic has its own dedicated section where notes can be reviewed. 
-Open the console. There will be a list of topics with a topic suggested to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
